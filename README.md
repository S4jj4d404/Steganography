# Steganography Tool
Since I wanted to look into steganography for some time, this is a small project dedicated to steganography.

It provides functionality to **encode** a message in an image and to **decode** the message from the image.

Head over to [the github page](https://s4jj4d404.github.io/Steganography/) and check out the online decoder and encoder.

## About Steganography

Steganography is the art of hiding a message inside another message. In this case we will hide a text message inside an image.
An image will most propably go unnotified, not a bunch of people will suspect a message hidden inside an image.
Steganography is **no means of encryption**, just a way of hiding data inside an image.

If you want to learn about Steganography in detail head over to [the Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steganography).
